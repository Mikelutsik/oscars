- [ ] Must incorporate unit testing for a minimum of 2 classes.

### Presentation

- [ ] Presentation details 
    - [ ] Slides
    - [ ] Discuss project and/or process

## Non-Minimum

### Product

- [ ] The results returned contain data which correlates the Oscar category results with additional data from an outside source such as OMDb, TMDb, TVDb etc. by providing a link to an external site for the movie.
- [ ] The search feature allows limiting results to a date range.
- [ ] More than one category can be searched.
- [ ] More than one endpoint that delivers a collection resource.
- [ ] More than one endpoint that delivers a singleton resource.
- [ ] GUI for the product (or portions thereof).
- [ ] Well-designed HTML page documenting API endpoints and example inputs/outputs.

### Process

- [ ] Incorporate test-driven development practice for one Sprint.
    - As evidenced by timestamps on check in for test code vs. check in for implementation code.
- [ ] Refactory code in a significant manner with a clear and stated goal for refactoring.
    - As evidenced by an implemented story from the Product Backlog with corresponding work in repository.
- [ ] Incorporate Contextual Inquiry/Elicitation techniques to create visual persona(s) and develop additional personas.
    - As evidenced by notes taken from the inquiries and creation of additional visual persona(s) beyond the minimum (part of deliverable 2).
- [ ] Create mockups for proposed GUI (even if not implemented).
- [ ] Incorporate pair programing during one Sprint.
    - As evidenced by a 1-minute clip of a recording in-person or Use Together session with link included in final deliverable.
- [ ] Incorporate one or more design patterns.
    - Indicate in user story which design pattern for which class(es) and provide comments in code (checked in to repository).
- [ ] Adopt a coding standard and follow it.
    - As evidenced by its inclusion in the repository.
- [ ] Use a database to store and retrieve Oscar data using queries.
- [ ] Analyze code using SonarQube or similar tool.
    - As evidenced by screenshot of SonarQube analysis.
- [ ] Explain and document obstacles encountered during the project and how those obstacles were handled.
